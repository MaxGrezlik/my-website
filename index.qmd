## Hi, I’m Max Grezlik — Fishery Data Analyst

I'm a fisheries scientist with a passion for data-driven solutions in marine conservation and resource management. My work bridges the gap between ecological research and applied fisheries science, with a strong focus on quantitative methods, ecosystem based fisheries management, and sustainable fisheries.

I regularly use **R**, **RStudio**, and **GitHub** to build tools, analyze complex datasets, and communicate findings. This site is a hub for my current projects, publications, and CV.

Whether you're a collaborator, a fellow scientist, or just curious about fisheries research, welcome!
